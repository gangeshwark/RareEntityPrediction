In an early pre- clinical study in mice , researchers demonstrated that a dietary supplement may help inhibit development of 9202a8c04000641f800000000001e9a7 resistance and 9202a8c04000641f8000000000b9a064 , conditions involved in development of Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.In this early pre-clinical study , a naturally produced amino acid-like molecule called GABA ( Gama Amino Butiric Acid ) was given orally to mice those were obese , insulin resistant and in the early stages of Type 2 diabetes.those are involved in the development of this condition.According to study authors , GABA helped prevent disease progression and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity , even after onset of Type 2 diabetes in mice . Researchers also identified the regulatory immune cells that likely direct GABA 's activity in inhibiting inflammation . , Australian researchers have isolated a ' master gene ' that controls Type 2 diabetes and say drugs that prevent or reverse the condition by switching off the gene may be as little as five years awayA number of genes are required for the normal functioning of insulin producing 9202a8c04000641f800000000006ce73 in pancreas . The gene the researchers identified is probably the master regulator of those other genes . `` That is why , it would be an effective gene to target , '' said Dr . Ross Laybutt , whose paper on the finding , titled 'Inhibition ofAugments Insulin Secretion and Protects Against High-Fat DietInduced Glucose Intolerance ' , is published today in the journal Diabetes . '' If we can block this gene , we might be able to prevent or even reverse diabetes . '' Dr . Laybutt said the gene , known as Id1 , was already known to play a role in cancer and that drugs targeting this gene already exist.He is now planning tests to see if those drugs could work to 'switch off ' Id1 and prevent or reverse Type 2 diabetes .
You Can Choose How You Feel Although I am unable to remember the first time I encountered the idea that it is possible to choose how you feel in any given moment , the effects of this realisation have been immense . I have certainly encountered the idea in many books and 9202a8c04000641f800000000011797e courses since . If this is a new idea to you , then to explain as simply as possible : In any given moment , it is possible to choose how you feel . In fact all your emotions are your own choice and responsibility . Although at times , an emotional response seems to be triggered by an event , the choice of 9202a8c04000641f800000000001661c is your own to make . You are in charge of your reaction to all situations and events . But surely I feel bad because of the things that happen If this is the first time you have encountered this idea , it can be hard to swallow . Indeed , it 's reassuring to believe that there are reasons outside of your control that mean you feel bad -particularly if you are depressed . However , this leads to a roller-coaster of a life with your emotions swinging from high to low . If you study people who are happy , you 'll find that they operate in a totally different way . They are in charge of their emotional responses and although there are genuinely times when they choose to feel sad , angry or another `` negative '' emotion , they are predominantly set to happy . There are many benefits to this way of thinking and when you are under pressure , it can serve to help you remain calm and think clearly at a time when others can not . You have a feelings habit This is really another of those `` habits '' that requires development and practice . It is also fair to say that there are occasions when it all gets forgotten and an automatic response or feeling occurs . This is a habit you have been practising for many years and will take time to un-learn . With awareness comes responsibility Once you become aware of your ability to choose your emotion or emotional response , your next step is to take responsibility and begin to change your old habits . If you decide to take steps , then congratulations , you are on the road to reduced stress and increased effectiveness in everything you do . Plus , you get to be in control of how you feel .
I resisted it at first . I already have very meaningful work teaching and writing and coaching people in living a more conscious integral life , particularly helping them deepen in Integral Life Practice . I teach meditation , shadow work , exercise , taking meta-perspectives , and understanding Integral theory . I work with truly amazing individuals in the process of doing this . It 's not like I needed to find `` relevance '' in my work , after all .. . . Jeff Salzman , Huy Lam , Diane Hamilton , Fred Kofman , Sofia Diaz , me , and Ken Wilber ( at Ken 's loft in early 2006 for a planning meeting on a new Integral Life Practice seminar ) But I found myself feeling called to go to Iran . Why ? I do n't have special expertise in Middle Eastern languages , culture , politics , or religion . I 'm not even a conventional political activist . Why should I be going to Iran ? 9202a8c04000641f800000000001e1f5 is a very interesting place . It 's the most highly educated populace in the Middle East ; a place of tremendous intellectual and spiritual ferment , with 60 % + of its college students women ; more bloggers per capita ( some argue ) than anywhere else in the world ( Farsi is said to be the 3rd most used language on the web after English and Mandarin ! ) ; and the the political and spiritual center of the most mystical ( and sometimes fanatical form ) of Islam , Shia Islamalso home to many practicing Sufis . Persia also produced Rumi ( who they call Molavi ) and Hafez , two great mystical realizers and also two of my very favorite poets of all time . It has a unique form of governmentpart theocracy and part democratic republic , peopled by vigorous intellectual and political debate . And many fear Iran and the US are currently on a collision course toward war . But why should I go there ? Because I 'm `` called '' ? It seems like that , but it sounds a little odd to say so . It has just kept coming up , as if out of left field . I felt a little like the Richard Dreyfus character in the first half of `` Close Encounters , '' piling my mashed potatoes into the shape of Devil 's Mountain , gripped by a mysterious call to go on a rendezvous beyond his understanding . The idea of visiting Iran somehow would n't go away . I kept trying to talk myself out of it ( for many very good reasons ! ) . But it did n't work . So in one more day , I fly to Tehran as a member of a civilian diplomacy delegation organized by the Fellowship of Reconciliation . We have been in touch with the government there . Our delegation 's Iran representatives have requested meetings with President Ahmedinejad , former 9202a8c04000641f80000000001535da , Grand Ayatollah Sanii , several parliamentarians , other Shia clergy , representatives of minority religions , and others . I made my commitment around New Year 's day . Since then , tension and saber-rattling between the US and Iran ( never absent ) seems to have suddenly built to quite a crescendo . Meanwhile , I 've been devouring books and blogs and movies , learning whatever I can . First pass bottom line : I 'm a pretty well-informed guy , but from our media I had gotten only a stick-figure and distorted impression of Iranian culture , politics , and religion . Persia is way more diverse , alive , complex , and multidimensional than I dreamed ! If you 've got 90 minutes , check out a very interesting movie , `` Rageh Inside Iran , '' by a BBC journalist who fell in love with the place , just released on Google Video . I 've also considered my purpose in going . My highest intention is to connect with some really awake Iranians and help support the emergence of Integral perspectives there , such that they can become influential . And to have any hope of doing that , I 'm letting go of attachment to the results . To paraphrase Gail Hochachka 's sage advice to me : Once the choice is made , it 's best to focus on planting the seeds you really want to plant . You ca n't know which ones will sprout , or whether they 'll sprout in hours , days , weeks , decades , or never . Best to just relax , enjoy , and go plant the best seeds you can ! So I 've written a letter to former President Khatami ( a heroic figure in Iran today , and quite an Integral thinker and leader , at least on a good day ) and a more general letter . I selected a few short documents that I think might be understandable and congenial to people there . And I found Al Eslami , a gracious Farsi translator , and with his help created a little library of Integral documents . If you 're interested to see them , here 's a list , with links to the files : If you want to read the rest of this blog , it 's easiest to understand when read in order , which means reading from bottom to top , starting in February , and then going to March , then April , etc .
This was the annual wine tasting and fundraising dinner for the Band and Orchestra department of our school . For the event , I had prepared a selection of wines that I thought would best showcase the wide diversity of the Italian production . We started with two whites and some antipasti , followed by four reds served with beef braised in wine and a cheese platter . Finally , a sweetwine and an almond and apricot cake ended the dinner and an extremely enjoyable evening.The wines we tasted : Tocai Friulano is a white grape native to the Friuli region of Northeastern Italy . The wine is produced by Azienda Agricola Ermacora , a small family owned winery in the Colli Orientali del Friuli district , just a few miles from the Slovenian border . My notes : light yellow color , ripe pear and sugar cane aromas on the nose , fresh acidity on the palate , mineral finish . Great with Prosciutto con Melone . Arneis is a rare and , until recently , almost extinct white grape cultivated in the Roero area of the Piedmont wine region . Malvir is a small family estate in Roero . The namerelates to the former location of the winery , which faced north instead of south : stands for wrong andfor situated . My notes : straw color , flowery nose . Slightly fizzy at first , the wine has more body and complexity than the Tocai Friulano . Really good . 2005 Vietti Barbera d'Alba Tre Vigne : the Vietti family has been making wines in Piedmont 's Barolo region since the middle of the 19th Century . The Barbera d'Alba Tre Vigne comes from 35 year-old 9202a8c04000641f8000000000257a01 vines sourced from three estate vineyards in Monforte , Barolo and Castiglione Falletto . My notes : bright red color , spices and black cherry on the nose , juicy on the palate , extremely well balanced and food friendly . Very good with the braised beef . 2005 Morgante Nero d'Avola : 9202a8c04000641f800000000059a309 is one of the main indigenous grapes of Sicily . The wine is produced by Morgante , a winery located in the province of Agrigento , on the southern coast of Sicily . The property has 200 hectares of vineyards and almond trees growing at 300-500 meters above sea level . My notes : plum and prune on the nose with some dried herbs notes , savory and creamy on the palate , cinnamon and moka on the finish . Tasted wonderful with braised beef as well.meansand Bibi Graetz , an artist that has become a winemaker , makes his wines in a powerful style . This 9202a8c04000641f8000000006c1eb9a is a classic Tuscan blend of 80 % Sangiovese , 10 % Colorino , 10 % Canaiolo . My notes : dark color , rich berry nose , dense on the palate . Still very young , needs more cellaring time . 2004 Cesari Amarone della Valpolicella Classico : 9202a8c04000641f80000000001b3b3a is a unique red wine from the Valpollicella wine region , in the province of Verona . It is made of grapes ( usually a blend of Corvina , Rondinella , and Molinara ) traditionally dried on straw mats . This drying process , which typically lasts 3 months , concentrates the juices within the grape and intensifies the flavors . My notes : dark color , nose of sweet plum , rich and spicy on the palate with notes of cinnamon , long finish , perfectly well balanced and really good with aged Parmesan cheese . Perhaps my favorite red wine of the evening . Malvasia delle Lipari is produced in the 9202a8c04000641f800000000005d766 , the largest of the Eolian Islands . It is made from overripe Malvasia grapes that are then sun-dried for 10 to 15 days on large bamboo mats . My notes : deep golden color , aromatic muscat-like nose , luscious palate with a vibrant acidity . Superb with the almond and apricot cake.We all had such a great time and were ready to meet again next year for another Band and Orchestra fundraising dinner . As for the theme , the decision was unanimous : Spanish wines . Not a problem for me , Spanish wines are awesome !
INside Jewish SynagogueThe Paradesi Synagogue is the oldest 9202a8c04000641f800000000005fcde in the 9202a8c04000641f8000000000081f5f located in 9202a8c04000641f800000000006c858 , 9202a8c04000641f8000000000aebd10 , in 9202a8c04000641f8000000000311973 . It was built in 1568 by the 9202a8c04000641f8000000000277b6c people or Cochin Jewish community in the Kingdom of Cochin . Paradesi is a word used in several Indian languages , and the literal meaning of the term is `` foreigners '' , applied to the synagogue because it was historically used by `` White Jews '' , a mixture of Jews from 9202a8c04000641f8000000000370114 , the 9202a8c04000641f8000000000026f1e , and European exiles . It is also referred to as the Cochin Jewish Synagogue or the Mattancherry Synagogue . The synagogue is located in the quarter of Old Cochin known as Jew Town , and is the only one of the seven synagogues in the area still in use . The complex has four buildings . It was built adjacent to the 9202a8c04000641f8000000000a216a2 9202a8c04000641f800000000005f085 on the land gifted to the Malabari Yehuden community by the Raja of Kochi , Rama Varma . The Mattancherry Palace temple and the Mattancherry synagogue share a common wall.HistoryThe Malabari Jews formed a prosperous trading community of Kerala , and they controlled a major portion of world wide 9202a8c04000641f8000000000284b03 . In 1568 , the Jews of Kerala constructed the Paradesi Synagogue adjacent to Mattancherry Palace , 9202a8c04000641f800000000006c858 , now part of the Indian city of 9202a8c04000641f8000000000a29587 , on land given to them by Paraja , the Raja of Kochi . The original synagogue was built in the 4th century in 9202a8c04000641f8000000000370114 ( Cranganore ) when the Jews had a mercantile role in the South Indian region along the Malabar coast now called Kerala . It was later moved to Kochi from Kodungallur.The first synagogue of the Malabari Jews in Cochin was destroyed in the Portuguese persecution of the Malabari Jews and 9202a8c04000641f8000000000192bf8 people of Kerala in the 1500s . The second synagogue , built under the protection of the Raja of Cochin along with Dutch patronage , is the present synagogue . It is called Paradesi synagogue because it was built with Dutch patronage at a time when Kochi was under Dutch occupation , thus the name paradesi synagogue or `` foreign synagogue '' .In 1968 , the synagogue celebrated its 400th anniversary in a ceremony attended by 9202a8c04000641f800000000001f253 , the 9202a8c04000641f8000000000030dd6 .Social composition and traditionsThe Paradesi Synagogue had three classes of members , all of whom together constitute the Malabar Yehudan or Cochin Jews.White Jews , belonging to higher class of professionals and merchants , were full members . The White Jews were mostly descendants of European and Middle Eastern Jews who made their way to India.Black Jews , consisting of traders and craftsmen , were allowed to pray but were not admitted to full membership . The Black Jews were ethnically and physically similar to the gentile Indian population.Meshuhrarim , a group of freed slaves , had no communal rights and no synagogue of their own , sat on the floor or on the steps outside.As is normal for 9202a8c04000641f800000000002cfa9 synagogues , the Paradesi Synagogue has separate seating sections for men and women.The Paradesi Synagogue is the only functioning synagogue in Kochi today with a 9202a8c04000641f80000000002b9511 ( though this minyan must be formed with Jews from outside Kochi , as the number who still reside there is not sufficient ) . In conformity with the Hindu and Islamic traditions of Kerala , the worshippers are required to enter the Paradesi Synagogue barefoot . Other facets which are unique to the Cochin Jewish community , and which are results of Hindu influence , include special colors of clothing for each festival , circumcision ceremonies at public worship , and distribution of grapes soaked myrtle leaves on certain festivals . In addition , the Cochin Jews have no rabbis , the community is led by elders.Objects of antiquityThe Paradesi Synagogue has the Scrolls of the Law , several gold crowns received as gifts , many Belgian glass chandeliers , and a brass-railed 9202a8c04000641f80000000001924ed . It houses the copper plates of privileges given to Joseph Rabban , the earliest known Cochin Jew , dating from the 10th century , written in Tamil on the two plates , by the ruler of the 9202a8c04000641f80000000003df437 . The floor of the synagogue is composed of hundreds of Chinese , 18th century , hand-painted porcelain tiles , all of which are unique . There is also an 9202a8c04000641f800000000094a2cd , a gift from Haile Selassie , the last Ethiopian Emperor . The most visible part of the synagogue is the 18th century clocktower , which , along with other parts of the complex , underwent repair work between 1998 and 1999 . Hebrew inscription at the Mattancherry synagogueA tablet from the earlier synagogue in Kochangadi in Kochi ( built in 1344 ) is placed on the outerwall of the Paradesi synagogue . The inscription states that the structure was built in the year 5105 ( in the 9202a8c04000641f800000000001c874 ) as an abode for the spirit of God .
Technical Topics Talking about Cons % of readers think this story is Fact . Add your two cents . Joanna Bourne , Historical Romance It is just hard to discover how con artists in the Regency period . I 'm fairly sure the current con games practiced in 1910 and in 2010 were practiced in 1810 , even though I do n't find references to them so much . The 9202a8c04000641f80000000001c402a , for instance , is said to date from the late Nineteenth Century . I imagine it was practiced , though , under another name in the Fifteenth . And Sixteenth . And in the regency . Human nature does n't change much . So , what do we know about Regency Con Games and how can we talk about playing them . Picking up general background stuff : Mayhew 's Characters , which is a generation later , but delightfully detailed and in voice And more on background criminal behavior Thieves Kitchen : The Regency Underworld by Donald Low Grose lists several sort of scamming beggars , largely folks faking injury or war service and so on . Those are some of the old traditions and accustomed cons . 9202a8c04000641f800000000025362d is ancient . It was called Thimblerig , played with three thimbles and a pea or button , is attested from 1825 by this name , though references to thimble cheats , probably the same swindle , date back to 1716 . The term 'Shell Game ' is 1890 , from a version of three-card monte played with a pea and walnut shells . So is fast and loose . Do n't know whether this counts as a con or not . The wikis here and here list some latish Nineteenth Century examples that ca n't be applied exact and directly to the Regency . My great sorrow as a writer is that we lack a rich , traditional vocabulary to talk about con men . I 've gone looking for scamming language and almost all the terminology I fall in love with is mid C19 or later . Here are some of the words we can use : Swindler is 1774 , `` giddy person , extravagant speculator , cheat , '' Said to have been introduced in London by German Jews c.1762 . Chouse `` swindler , swindle , '' 1650s , from Turk . chaush `` sergeant , herald , messenger , '' ( Good Regency usage for this . ) Double cross is much older than I thought , dating to 1834 , from double + cross in the sense of `` pre-arranged swindle or fix . '' Originally to win a race after promising to lose it . As a verb from 1903 , Amer.Eng . Dodge Common from early 18c . in figurative sense of `` to swindle , to play shifting tricks . '' . Diddle `` to cheat , swindle , '' in 1806 , from dial . duddle , diddle `` to totter '' ( 1630s ) . One has to be aware of later meanings `` to have sex with '' is from 1879 ; that of `` to masturbate '' ( especially of women ) is from 1950s . Gouge 1560s meaning `` to cut as with a gouge , '' Meaning `` swindle '' is Amer.Eng . colloquial from 1826 . Con in the meaning `` swindling '' Is 1889 , Amer.Eng . Confidence man is 1849 . Derives from the many scams in which the victim is induced to hand over money as a token of confidence . . Fleece The verb is 1530s in the literal sense of `` to strip a sheep of fleece '' and 1570s in the figurative meaning `` to cheat , swindle . '' It holds that meaning to present day . Grab 1580s , `` to seize '' , often with a sense of `` to get by unscrupulous methods '' . The 'grab game ' is a kind of swindle , 1846 . Sting A slang meaning `` to cheat , swindle '' is from 1812 . The sense of `` police undercover entrapment '' is from 1975 . ( It would be lovely to use in 1812 if it were n't for the C20 meanings layered on top . ) Burn Meaning `` cheat , swindle , victimize '' is 1650s . ( Again , modern C20 meanings may intrude here . c.f . 'Burn Notice ' ) Mark . slang sense `` victim of a swindle '' is 1883 . Hornswoggle to cheat , '' 1829 . ( To me it sounds Amer Eng but I have n't looked it up ) Sharp `` a cheat at games , '' 1797 , short for sharper ( 1681 ) , probably a variant of sharker Rook . 1570s noun , `` a cheat , '' especially at cards or dice . Verb `` to defraud by cheating '' , originally especially in a game , 1580s . Cozen . To commit fraud , trickery '' mid-15C In use in the Regency . Trump . ( v ) `` fabricate , devise , '' 1690s , from trump `` deceive , cheat '' ( 1510s ) , 'Trumped up ' as `` false , concocted '' first recorded 1728 . Gull . cant term for `` dupe , sucker , credulous person , '' with a sense of `` someone who will swallow anything thrown at him . '' From 1590s Still in use today . Thug 1810 , `` member of a gang of murderers and robbers in India who strangled their victims , '' In general sense of `` ruffian , cutthroat '' first recorded 1839 . ( I have used this in 1812 with characters who would have contact with army officers serving in India . ) Chisel Slang sense of `` to cheat , defraud '' is first recorded in 1808 as chizzel . Origin and connection to the older word are obscure . ( Obscure , but in period and perhaps useful . ) Stall . Mid-15C as `` pretense to avoid doing something . '' A variant of `` stale '' bird used as a decoy to lure other birds . In the meaning of `` evasive trick or story , pretext , excuse '' first recorded 1812 . This sense entwined with that of `` thief 's assistant '' ( 1590s ) . '' The stallers up are gratified with such part of the gains acquired as the liberality of the knuckling gentlemen may prompt them to bestow . [ J.H . Vaux , `` Flash Dictionary , '' 1812 ] '' Stall '' is still used as a pickpocket 's assistant . humbug , 1751 , student slang , `` trick , jest , hoax , deception , '' also as a verb . chicanery c.1600 , from Fr . chicanerie `` trickery , '' jape . early 14c . , `` trick , deceit , '' later `` a joke , a jest '' ( late 14c . ) It 's been through several transitions , but currently means a joke or jest . jig . `` lively dance , '' 1560s , A `` piece of sport , trick '' 1590s . Phrase the jig is up ( first attested 1777 as the jig is over ) . sham 1670s , `` a trick , a hoax , a fraud , '' Sense of `` Something meant to be mistaken for something else '' is from 1728 . RITA-winning author Joanna Bourne writes historical fiction set in Revolutionary and Napoleonic France and Regency England . It was a time of love and sacrifice , clashing ideals , and really cool clothing .
Free web hosting service A free web hosting service is a 9202a8c04000641f80000000001257c4 that is free , usually 9202a8c04000641f8000000000008700 -supported and of limited functionality . Free web hosts will either provide a 9202a8c04000641f80000000003731cf ( yourname.example.com ) or a directory ( www.example.com/~yourname ) . In contrast , paid web hosts will usually provide a 9202a8c04000641f8000000000594d14 along with the hosting ( www.yourname.com ) . Some free hosts do allow use of separately-purchased domains . Rarely , a free host may also operate as a 9202a8c04000641f8000000000257738 , but their registry services are usually more expensive than others . A few free web hosts have a basic package for free , and enhanced packages ( with more features ) for a cost . This allows users to try the service for an initial trial ( see how it performs compared to other hosts ) , and then upgrade when ( and if ) needed . Free hosting may be having the following limitation : Limitation on the size of each hosted file Very small bandwidth per month compared to paid hosting Prevents hotlinking of files Do not allow certain file types ( for example 9202a8c04000641f8000000000027960 , 9202a8c04000641f8000000000028495 etc . ) Automatic insertion of banner ad or popup ads into all web pages Do not provide any uptime guarantee Some free host may provide these extra features : A web based control panel File transfer via FTP Scripting languages : PHP , ASP Relational databases such as MySQL Scheduled processes , known as cronjobs Free email accounts for the domain or subdomain hosted File hosting Most free web hosts discourage using their services for file or image hosting only , with no 9202a8c04000641f8000000000041a8f , since advertising is displayed on the web page . Because of this , 9202a8c04000641f80000000001d9d53 is usually disallowed on free hosts . Some free webhosts will also disallow files over a certain size ( for example , 5 MB ) . However , there are 9202a8c04000641f80000000005a6d3e which allow large files as well as hotlinking . Forum-based free hosting Some free hosts require posting in a 9202a8c04000641f80000000001b88a7 . Forum-based free hosting requires users to either reach a certain amount of posts before getting a free hosting account , or be an active contributor in the forum . Forum-based free hosting often work on a system of points where posts give points to a user and can be used as credits toward getting a hosting account or more resources .
Help Reactivate the Economy , Support Southern Cone Travel Following its spectacular June 4 eruption , the Volcn Puyehue-Cordn Caulle Complex appears to be slowly subsiding , but its effects are not going away any time soon . The prevailing westerlies have deposited most of the ash in Argentina , but some of it has carried all the way across the Pacific to Australia ( as depicted in the NASA image above ) and New Zealand ( see NASA image below ) , where it has also disrupted flights . On Friday , Silvina Garay of Say Hueque Tours in Buenos Aires that `` when I left work , I saw that my car was full of dust and today more than yesterday ! Today all flights are cancelled - domestic and international . A real problem that 's affecting the entire country , keeping both tourists and residents from traveling . '' That continued through the weekend , but according to this morning 's Buenos Aires Herald , flights into and out of the city are due to resume today . The LAN Airlines website , however , states that flights into and out of Buenos Aires , Crdoba and Montevideo are still suspended , along with trans-Pacific routes to Auckland ( New Zealand ) and Sydney ( Australia ) . According to Raymond Poole , who wrote me from the Falkland Islands , the eruption has been a minor annoyance , with a small ash fall on one day - `` LAN came and went as usual , the Airbridge [ from the UK via 9202a8c04000641f8000000000007948 ] has been delayed for a few days , but is due today .

My friend Joaqun Allolio , a wool consultant in Buenos Aires , sent me a note about eruption on the city and , especially , the Patagonian livestock industry : `` Here in B.A . , even inside the houses grey ashes were mixed with the usual city dust on the floors . '' '' Flights are slowly resuming to central and northern domestic destinations , but all flights to Patagonia are suspended .

'' '' The situation is very serious in the farming areas inside Ro Negro , Jacobacci and Maquinchao being the most mentioned locations . They are seeking to declare a farming emergency , as they already had had long drought periods . The problem is double : ashes covering the scarce grasslands [ the Argentine side of Patagonia is mostly desert or semi-desert , as in the photograph above ] , which they are trying to solve by bringing many forage bales for the smaller farmers especially . But ashes remain on top of the fleeces , helped by snow and/or rain to consolidate into a heavy 'brick ' which weighs on the sheep and definitely weakens it . '' '' This situation includes also Northern Chubut , and just while writing these lines , I spoke with my friend Sergio Pena , General Director of Livestock and Agriculture of the province , and he was just entering an emergency meeting at Trelew s Chubut Valley Rural Society . '' '' Fortunately , INTA Bariloche has taken quick action and , taking advantage especially of the experience gathered in 2008 when the Chaitn volcano erupted and sent its ashes into Argentine Patagonia , sent out three different reports on the situation , including definite recommendations for the growers , with practical advice how to cope with the situation . '' Among other problems , the ash wears down the teeth so that sheep can not feed properly , even when forage is available.On the Chilean side , according to Montevideo-based Mercopress Sernapesca Director Guillermo Rivera said that the eruption killed more than 4.5 million fish in the Ro Nilahue , which descends from the north slope of the Cordn de Caulle into Lago Ranco - whose temperature rose to 113 F - briefly , at least , thus huge glacial remnant experienced hot springs temperatures . Some evacuees , though , have been allowed to return home and , again according to Mercopress , repairs of the road across the Paso Cardenal Samor have commenced Immediately south of the eruption zone , Armin Dbendorfer of the Zapato Amarillo B & B in Puerto Octay reports little damage on and around Lago Llanquihue , but his vision of the first days is vivid : `` We could see a huge column of smoke and ash forming an impressive mushroom 10-12 km high . Sunday we went to Lago Puyehue , but could n't see much because of all the ash in the atmosphere . At night there were electrical storms and lightning . After Monday a Pacific storm with strong winds carried most of the ash to Villa La Angostura and Bariloche . Wednesday we could see the column of smoke again , and it has subsided to only half its previous height . '' On the Argentine side , Jane Williams of Estancia Huechahue , which specializes in horseback trips in Argentina 's Neuqun province but also hosts fly-fishermen , reports that `` we have some ash but no more than Esquel got from Chaiten , and they say the fishing was great there that year ! '' On the Chubut coast , a press communiqu from the town of Puerto Pirmides claims that , `` despite the so-called rain of ashes that affects a large part of Chubut province , all services at the town of Puerto Pirmides are operating normally , particularly whale-watching , accommodations , restaurants and overland transportation . '' What this does n't mention , of course , is the difficulty of getting to the nearest airport , at Puerto Madryn or Trelew , to be able to visit Pennsula Valds . Even presuming you can get to Buenos Aires , the overland trip to Chubut is a long one.If you have found this article informative , please consider clicking on one or more of the AdSense links that accompany it - always presuming , of course , that it 's a product or service that interests you .
Gabriel of Urantia and Spiritualution '' I 'm either insane or egotistically mad , or I am who I say I am . '' Gabriel of Sedona Update June 21 , 2012 : Added footnote to Preserving Dateline 's Expos on Gabriel of Sedona Last month during the protests of the NATO summit in Chicago , one of the many livestreams I found to watch was run by a couple of guys who were affiliated with an organization called `` Spiritualution `` a spiritual revolution . I enjoyed their stream and was intrigued by a few of the things they said , especially their mention of the founder of their organization , Gabriel of Urantia . As something of a junkie when it comes to purportedly divine revelations , I was compelled to do a little bit of googling . It turns out he 's exactly the sort of character you 'd expect with a name like that . He was born as Anthony Delevin in Pittsburgh in 1947 . After stints as a charismatic catholic , a protestant pastor ( operating the Son Light Ministries in Tuscon ) , and a musician , he joined a commune in the 9202a8c04000641f8000000000b4c5b9 east of Phoenix , AZ . It was there that he first claimed to have been contacted by celestial beings . In 1989 he co-founded a church-like organization in southern Arizona , the Global Community Communications Alliance , with Ninn Emerson Chase . By that time he was calling himself Gabriel of Sedona , and he was active in environmental conservation projects in the Sedona , AZ , area . His cosmology is based on a mix of religious teachings including a bit of Christianity , Mormonism , Hopi tradition , and the 9202a8c04000641f800000000013b39f . Like many guru types he claims to have been many famous characters in past lives ( including Alexander the Great , Francis of Assisi , and George Washington ) . And because the Urantia Book , at only 2,000 pages , contains insufficient knowledge for the human race , he was selected as the medium for the channeling of the continuation of that revelation which has taken form as two volumes ( so far ) of The Cosmic Family ( `` The Continuing Fifth Epochal Revelation '' ) . By 1997 his cosmic family who lived with him on a commune he called the Aquarian Concept Community consisted of about 70-100 adults and was organized as a typical religious cult . He traveled ( still does ? ) around to gigs performing `` transmissions , '' acting as the mouthpiece for various celestial beings . I found an interesting account of one Urantia Book believer and would-be Gabriel-follower ( `` An Evening with Gabriel of Sedona '' by Keith Graham ) who excitedly attended one of Gabriel 's transmissions ( where he was to channel `` The Bright and Morning Star of Salvington , Head Administrator of our Local Universe , the Finaliter Paladin , and The Present Planetary Prince Machiventa Melchizedek '' ) only to conclude that Gabriel was a false prophet when one of his personas declared , `` Gabriel of Sedona is the most highly evolved human being on the planet . '' In 1998 Dateline NBC aired an expos on Gabriel and the cultish aspects of his Aquarian Concept Community . Not only did they interview Gabriel and several ex-members of the community , but they had two undercover reporters join the commune with hidden cameras over a period of three months . Despite dubious legal efforts by Gabriel 's organization to suppress the circulation of that video on the web , I found a copy and have embedded it below in a fancy Flash player for your enjoyment . The Global Community Communications Alliance purchased some land in 9202a8c04000641f8000000000098977 , Arizona , and Gabriel began moving his community and various operations away from Sedona to this new headquarters in 2007 . Today the community runs the Avalon Organic Gardens & Ecovillage there , which , despite the whole thing where they follow a guy who thinks pretending to talk to aliens grants him some sort of authority , looks like a neat place . In 2009 the Arizona Republic published an article ( with a rather sensationalist title : `` Order in Tubac prepares for apocalypse `` ) on the group , its beliefs , and the media attention it has received . The article drew [ forced ] parallels between Gabriel and 9202a8c04000641f800000000802faf0 whose Sedona-area group became infamous after one of its members died in a sweat lodge ritual . The comments section of the Arizona Republic article includes some responses from members of Gabriel 's group , including one from a poster named TSE123 : '' I have been and continue to be a member of Global Community Communications Alliance for over 14 years . I have grown and continue to grow up here . I have met a gorgeous and smart partner ; I have 3 kids born here who are beautiful ; their school is incredible ; we eat organic fresh food every day , we have fresh air , amazing water ( fluoride and chlorine-free ) , I can see the stars in clear skies at night and know most of the constellations and how the earth is moving among them , I count my blessings for good health , and I have learned here in this community that I am not the center of the universe . When I came to this community I was really spoiled and a brat . I now actually realize there are human beings in the US and in other countries that I consider my brother and sister who are seriously struggling and are exploited . I have grown enough to know that changing this matters . We run rehabilitation programs and provide year-round internships in organic gardening , farming , sustainable building , and life skills training . Sometimes the basic truth of what our reality represents is difficult for others to deal with . '' TSE123 - Global Community Communications Alliance member Whatever else you may say about him , he is a man of many domain names : He can also be found on youtube , facebook , and twitter . Those who are interested can also find his resume linked from several of his websites . The most redeeming aspect of his whole prophet shtick is his `` spiritualution '' concept which , according to the livestreamers I was watching , he began talking about in the late 1990s . As a movement it is against corporatism and in favour of self-sufficiency , environmentalism , and civil disobedience , and so it dovetails nicely with the Occupy Wall Street movement . However , this quote from his article `` The Occupy Movement Needs To Fuse With The Spiritualution Movement To Win Against The 1 % '' sadly ( or hilariously ) speaks for itself to those curious about the intellectual foundation of his various spiritual concepts : '' Every physics student knows that the mind seems to move particles when looking through a microscope . This is called the Heisenberg Principle . Therefore we get the equation 'thoughts equal energy ' . '' Gabriel of Urantia
BACKGROUND Back in 1987 while employed with the Queen Victoria Museum , I became a field assistant to Dr . T . D . Shwaner who at the time was working for the South Australian Museum as a 9202a8c04000641f8000000000026af9 , studying Island snake populations on Mt . Chappell Island . Dr . Schwaner , or Terry , took me under his wing and allowed me to become more personally involved , with support from the QVMAG and my own resources I became Co Researcher , with Terry as the principal . The 9202a8c04000641f8000000007b4ef85 project lasted almost 10 years before the Island was ceded to the Tasmanian Aboriginal Community , and Terry Moved back to his country of origin , USA . WESLEY VALE Wesley Vale Project , where we jointly gathered data on over 300 copperhead and tiger snakes over an eleven-year period . In 2000 another Island chapter was initiated and along with reptile enthusiast Jane Guy from the QVMAG I embarked on the , where we jointly gathered data on over 300 copperhead and tiger snakes over an eleven-year period . With so many snakes micro chipped , we were able to establish growth and weight data sets as more and more recaptures eventuated , value adding to the project . 2007-8 saw the beginning of a three-year drought that dried the marshland over that period and decimated the population . Large snakes with large body mass were unable to sustain there viability , evidenced by significant mortality amongst the population . As annual rainfalls increased and the marshland regenerated with a variety of life forms , everything appeared as it was prior to 2007 ; but alas , not the snakes . The question now is , was this a natural climatic event that may be a repeat of times past , or 9202a8c04000641f800000000005e136 , and how resilient is the snake population ? These are questions that will drive the research for years into the future , and may prove to be a predictor of climate change , as history repeats itself in similar concentrated populations .
Le Manoir du Parc Saint-L-d'Ourville is a souvenir of rural life in the 9202a8c04000641f80000000001eb203 during the 15th and 16th centuries . Its architecture presents a variety of elements which have come to symbolize the power of a lord in a 9202a8c04000641f80000000000180c7 complete with stately manor house , chapel , dovecote , moats , defensive towers , a mill and cider house all grouped around a large courtyard . In 1998 , owner Valentin Giard bought the manor house and surrounding lands with plans to completely renovate and restore the ruinous state of the buildings . He served as our guide and showed us this remarkable piece of cultural heritage . He was well versed in the manor 's history and lineage . Before the annexation of Normandy by the French king Philippe Auguste in 1204 , the fief and fort on this site belonged to the Aubigny family . The king had the castle and fort demolished and gave the fief to the Argence family who constructed a manor house that was passed down to the succeeding lords of Criqueboeuf , d'Argouges and Clamorgan . In the 15th century , the manor then passed to the family of La Rivire and , by succession , to that of Thieuville for almost one hundred years until the marriage of Marie de Thieuville and Franois de Pierrepont . The Pierrepont family were the lords of the manor until 1711 . After that , it went to Jean Antoine de Thre and finally to Barnabe d'Osmond Medavy . The last lord was Adolphe de Mauconvenant , a chevalier and marquis of Sainte-Suzanne . He died in 1829 in Valognes . After entering the property through the large welcoming hall , which has an amazing wood beam roof structure , one enters the main courtyard . To the right are three buildings that served specific purposes during feudal times . The old charretterie / wagon house is remarkable for its two walled arcades which rest on pillars topped with square capitals . Its location , near the monumental gate opening on the court , allowed people living outside of the mansion to deposit their royalties without having to enter the precincts . Beside the charreterrie is the old chapel , which dates to around 1450 . It is rectangular in form with its own small bell tower built into the wall . The remains of a window with fine stone tracery can be seen in one of the walls . Over time the functions of the chapel were lost ( perhaps during the French Revolution ) and the building was adapted for agricultural use . To the left of the chapel is a newer building that also served as a carriage house and stable . The manor house stands proudly within the courtyard surrounded by defensive towers that overlook the moat allowing for a stronger defense of the property and recalls the power and social status of the lord of the fief . Rectangular in shape , the main part of the manor house is divided in two parts by two interior walls that rise to three levels accessed by a spiral staircase beginning at the main entrance . The first part of construction began around 1480 . Reached by the stairs of the outside tower is a great room with a cellar topped with an upper room adjoining the western part of the building . The great room was an important element of life in the manor as it served a variety of functions both official and ceremonial . The room was often used to hear court cases where the lord served as judge and dispensed justice . Royalties to the lord were also paid here . More often than not , it was a place for socializing , accessible to all and where banquets and parties were held . The large beams that made up the upper floors are all that remain allowing the visitor to look up and see the large stone fireplaces that would have heated each room . The second phase of construction began in the late 16th and early 17th centuries when mullioned windows were added as well as a straight staircase . To the left is another smaller rectangular building of two levels . It is divided internally by a central bearing wall and originally included a wine cellar and bakery with access by an outside staircase . Some researchers believe that this building could have served as a private area reserved for the lord alone , elevated and separated from the great room . This was a traditional practice for lords in the Cotentin region during the 15th and 16th centuries . In the southwest corner of the part of the manor is a small tower called an chauguette which overlooks the moat and once served as a watchtower . Beside it , imbedded in the wall , are the niches of the former colombier / dovecote . It was the privilege of a lord to own and raise pigeons as a sign of his rank and social superiority . At the back of the manor house one can see the remains of defensive towers with splayed windows to aid in defending the property as well as an opening over the moat which once served as a drawbridge . The pressoir / cider house was one of the first buildings to be renovated by the current owner and now serves as a private residence for his mother . Other elements within the prerogative of the lord of the manor were the mill and the fishpond . The mill wheel was driven by the overflow of the moat , itself dependent on a particularly abundant source ( a stream which runs through the property ) . Downstream , a pool would form allowing for a fishpond . The pond not only offered fish for the lord 's dinner table but a place where ducks , geese and other birds could nest before they too were added to the menu .

MGM buys back United Artists , adds Peter Liguori to board Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has bought back full control of its historic film label United Artists , the independent studio revealed in financial results reported this week . It also disclosed for the first time that television industry veteran Peter Liguori has joined its board of directors . Lionsgate 's hotly anticipated adaptation of the bestselling book by Suzanne Collins ranks as the seventh highest ever total gross from `` midnight screenings '' ( Hollywood 's term for shows that start anytime from 12 a.m . on a film 's opening day until the sun rises ) .The six films ranked higher were the three most recent installments in the `` Harry Potter '' and `` Twilight '' series.Big turnouts for late-night shows are an indication of intense excitement among fans , who would rather stay up until dawn than wait a minute longer than necessary to see a film . And while they do n't guarantee that a movie will ultimately prove popular among broad audiences , a big midnight debut is an indicator that a picture will have a huge opening weekend.Every other film that has posted more than $ 16.6 million in midnight shows on a Friday ( the cut-off point for the top 10 ) has gone to take in well over $ 100 million on its opening weekend . `` The Hunger Games '' appears poised to do the same , with a debut as high as $ 150 million still possible.Industry experts are predicting that `` The Hunger Games '' could take in between $ 125 million and $ 150 million this weekend . If it does meet those expectations , that would give `` The Hunger Games '' the biggest debut for a non-sequel movie ever . Hey , if I have a ticket , that should tell you all you need to know about how well this movie will do . Box office previews from the Los Angeles Times and Variety . Playing devil 's advocate , Advertising Age columnist Seraj Bharwani predicts that `` The Hunger Games '' will take in only $ 80 million . Let 's ask Monday if he had to eat those words.I think `` Mad Men '' is back this Sunday but I 'm not sure . I wish there was just a little bit of promotion from AMC about it and a little more attention to the show from the media . Yes , that 's sarcasm . Friday 's headlines include a look at how big `` The Hunger Games '' will be this weekend and a scandal at one of the nation 's biggest broadcasters . Also , there is a rise in work for little people.Photo : Megan Hilty and Will Chase in the NBC musical drama `` Smash . Credit : NBCNBC announced Thursday that it was bringing back `` Smash , '' its musical drama about the making of a Broadway play about Marilyn Monroe . What NBC did n't say is that the show 's creator , Theresa Rebeck , would not be the show runner next season . There has been concern that some of the plots in `` Smash '' focus too much on arcane details of interest only to theater geeks ( and many of those , including my significant other , feel the show gets it wrong as much as it gets it right ) and that the program needs to broaden if it wants to be more than a niche show . At the same time , it is the backstage aspects of the show that draw in industry viewers , important for critical acclaim and a very specialized group of advertisers . More on the shakeup from Deadline Hollywood With religious broadcaster Trinity Broadcasting Network , one of the country 's biggest owners of local television stations , embroiled in scandal ( see below ) , it will be interesting to see if there 's any fallout from the government . The Federal Communications Commission wants local broadcasters to give up some of their airwaves to boost cellphones and new digital devices . If the accusations of fraud against TBN pan out , then in theory the FCC could try to reclaim their spectrum and have it auctioned or sold to wireless companies.Trinity Broadcasting Network , a religious broadcaster that owns more than 20 television stations around the country , has been accused of fraud by a former executive and relative of TBN co-founder Paul Crouch . Brittany Koper , who held senior positions at the Southern California-based broadcaster and is a granddaughter of Crouch , filed a lawsuit in Orange Country Superior Court accusing TBN brass of illegal financing schemes and using funds for personal purposes . Trinity has used its religious position to outstep and backdoor deals at the expense of commercial and public broadcasters .

In 2006 , UA became a joint venture between MGM , Tom Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner , who together got 30 % of the company . The new UA released only two movies , `` Lions for Lambs '' and `` Valkyrie , '' before Wagner departed as chief executive in 2008 , leaving the venture in limbo.But MGM said in its 2011 financial results that it now owns a 100 % interest in UA and it has bought back `` Lambs '' and `` Valkyrie , '' as well as two later films financed by UA : `` Hot Tub Time Machine '' and `` Fame . '' The company also said it `` may resume using the United Artists banner to develop and produce new films . '' After former Pixar executive Ann Mather was named MGM 's lead director in December 2010 , former NBC executive Jeff Gaspin was expected to be named to the ninth and final spot on the company 's board . Instead , MGM quietly tapped Ligouri , who was most recently chief operating officer of Discovery Communications and previously was a senior executive at the Fox network , for the spot.An MGM spokeswoman did not respond to a question about when Ligouri joined the board.In addtion to Mather , others on MGM 's board of directors include former CBS Chief Financial Officer Fredric Reynolds , former MySpace Co-President Jason Hirschhorn , co-CEOs Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum and representatives of the three investment funds with the largest stakes in the studio . '' Hangover '' director Todd Phillips is planning one more sequel to the hit movie . The Hollywood Reporter quotes Phillips saying , `` We 're going to surprise a lot of people with the final chapter we have planned .

NYS Living Environment Regents June 2006 Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 01 Organization of Life Correct Answer : Option 2 , tissue Tissues are made up of cells of similar structure and function ; therefore , the tissue is the next level of organization after a cell . Examples of tissues include blood , nervous and bone , among others . Human tissues have 4 basic types : connective , epithelial , muscle , and nerve . Option 1 is incorrect . A human is an example of an organism , the highest level of organization . Humans are made up of organ systems and can carry out all basic life processes . This means they can take in materials , release energy from food , release wastes , grow , respond to the environment , and reproduce . Option 3 is incorrect because a stomach is just an example of an organ . Organs are made up of tissues that work together to perform a specific activity . Option 4 is also incorrect because an organelle , like a nucleus , is only a part of a cell . Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 02 Evolution : Change Over Time Correct Answer : Option 2 E & I Species E and I both originated from species F . There are most likely more common shared characteristics ( synapomorphies ) between these two species than the other species given . Species C originated from species H , while species D from G . Since they have different most recent ancestor , they are not as closely related as E & I . Thus , option 1 is incorrect . This is also the case of options 3 . Option 4 is also incorrect . Though species A is the remote ancestor of all the given species , there have been many diversion from the original characteristic before species F came to existence . Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 03 Homeostasis Correct Answer : Option 3 low concentration ' high concentration ( ATP used ) Active transport is the mediated process of moving particles across a 9202a8c04000641f800000000000c190 against a concentration gradient . Active transport uses energy , unlike passive transport , which does not use any energy . ATP , a form or chemical energy , is needed for this process to take place . Indeed , this setup is an active transport . Since it uses chemical energy , it is termed as primary active transport . If electrochemical gradient was used in the process , it is called secondary active transport . Option 1 is incorrect because no energy is needed to move particles from high concentration to low concentration . Since there is no energy or ATP ( 9202a8c04000641f8000000000006538 ) needed for the process to happen , it is a passive transport . Option 2 is incorrect . Just like option 1 , no energy or ATP was used in the process therefore it is a passive transport . Option 4 is incorrect . ATP is needed in order to transport particles from low to high concentration . Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 04 Organization of Life Correct Answer : Option 3 nucleus , which has chromosomes that contain many genes . Genes is the basic unit of heredity in a living organism . They hold the information to build and maintain their cells and pass genetic traits to offspring . In general terms , a gene is a segment of nucleic acid that , taken as a whole , specifies a trait . Option 3 is correct because chromosomes are found in the `` control center '' of the cell-the nucleus . It contains most of the cell 's genetic material , organized as multiple long linear 9202a8c04000641f8000000000011b65 molecules in complex with a large variety of 9202a8c04000641f800000000002ef58 , such as histones , to form chromosomes . Option 1 is incorrect . Ribosomes are complexes of 9202a8c04000641f800000000003354d ( ribonucleic acid ) and 9202a8c04000641f800000000002ef58 that are found in all cells . Ribosomes do not contain chromosomes . The ribosome functions in the expression of the genetic code from nucleic acid into 9202a8c04000641f800000000002ef58 , in a process called translation . Option 2 is incorrect . Chromosomes are made up of genes , not genes contain chromosomes . Option 4 is incorrect . Chromosomes compose the nucleus yet it is not contained in genes . Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 05 Heredity and Genetics CORRECT ANSWER : Option 1 different genes function in each type of cell . Inside each cell are the genes , which give the cell information about how it is supposed to function . Genes are segments of DNA . Genes are turned on or off for cellular differentiation . For example , to produce the highly specialized nerve cells , only a fraction of the genes are expressed ( through transcription with the aid of enzymes ) to generate the specific structure and function of the cell . Option 2 is not the best answer . Though it is true that nerve cells are amitotic , meaning they can not reproduce , and liver cells can reproduce whenever there ii injury ; it is not the main reason why the two types of cells are different in structure and function . It still depends on the genes that dictate the characteristics of the cells . Option 3 is incorrect . The chromosome number is constant in all cells of an organism . For instance , humans have 46 chromosomes ( 44 are autosomal and the 2 are sex chromosomes ) Option 4 is incorrect . DNA is known as organism 's genetic `` fingerprint . '' Therefore , there is the same DNA found in different cells of the body . Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 06 Organization of Life CORRECT ANSWER : Option 2 simple sugars Starch , a complex carbohydrate , is a polymer of glucose molecules . The potato plant converts glucose ( a simple sugar or monosaccharide ) to starch by a process called starch synthesis . Basically , many glucose molecules link up and form a long chain , which has new properties and is known as starch or amylose . The actual bonds between glucose molecules are formed through dehydration synthesis . This process literally means assembling by removing water . An atom of hydrogen ( H ) is removed from one of the glucans , and a hydroxyl group ( OH ) is removed from another . ( The H and OH that were removed will react to form water , H2O . ) The removal of the H and OH leaves free reactive sites that join together , linking the two glucans by a glycosidic bond to form a disaccharide ( two sugars ) . Additional sugars are added to the chain by the same process to form the polysaccharide starch . Option 1 is incorrect . Enzymes just catalyze the reactions in the synthesis of starch . An example of enzyme used in starch synthesis is ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase ( AGPase ) , which catalyses the reaction of glucose-1-phosphate with ATP to form ADP-glucose ( liberating pyrophosphate ) . Option 3 and 4 are both incorrect . Amino acids and minerals are not simple sugars . Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 07 Heredity and Genetics Correct Answer : Option 1 specific sequences of bases in DNA in reproductive cells . Before cell division occurs , the cell first has to replicate the chromosomes so each daughter cell can have a set . Each chromosome is one long molecule of DNA with specific sequences of nitrogenous bases and special proteins . The DNA of the parent molecule is replicated to form the DNA of the offspring . Option 2 is incorrect . The function of proteins during reproduction is to `` turn off '' the genes that are not needed in that cell . For example , while every cell in your body contains exactly the same genes , you do n't need your eye-color gene operational in cells in your big toe , nor toenail-shape genes active in cells in your stomach . Option 3 is incorrect . The role of carbohydrates in reproduction is still under speculation . There are studies that have shown that glycosylation ( the systematic addition of carbohydrates to proteins or lipids ) contributes to the reproduction process ( e.g . interaction between the spermatozoa and the zona pellucida of oocyte ) ; however , not directly in the transmission of hereditary traits . Option 4 is incorrect . DNA is a polymer of monomers called nucleotides , each consisting of a pentose sugar ( deoxyribose ) and a phosphate group . Pentose is also a kind of sugar but it is not considered as starch . Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 08 Heredity and Genetics Correct Answer : Option 3 gene alteration in gametes . Option 1 is incorrect because in cloning , the genetic information of the parent is just the same with the offspring . Options 2 and 4 are incorrect . Mitosis in the muscle cells and differentiation in nerve cells only happens from further growth and development of the body . These can not be inherited by the following generation . Gene alterations in the gametes will form new inheritable characteristics . Since the gamete of the parents unite during sexual reproduction , if ever there would be alterations , the resulting diploid zygote would have a different gene expression that can be carried out to the next generations . Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 09 Heredity and Genetics Correct Answer : Option 1 mutation and gene recombination . Mutation refers to the changes to the nucleotide sequence of the genetic material of an organism . Since there is a change in the genetic information of the species , this can further cause evolution of the species . On the other hand , genetic recombination is the process wherein a strand of DNA is broken and joined to a different DNA molecule . This usually occurs during meiosis as chromosomal crossover between paired chromosomes . This leads to offspring with different combination of genes from their parents . Mitosis involves the distribution of identical DNA to two daughter cells . Its function is primarily for growth and development , not for variations in the succeeding generations of species . Natural selection is the differential success in reproduction caused by the adaptation of organisms to their environment . Option 2 is incorrect because not both mitosis and natural selection results to variation ( only natural selection causes variation ) . Extinction can not cause variation because the genetic information of an extinct species also disappears with it . Gene replacement can cause a change in the characteristics of a species . Therefore , only gene replacement is correct , making option 3 invalid . Selection would limit the variations that could influence the evolution of species . Selective breeding is in contrast with natural selection , according to Charles Darwin . Thus , option 4 is incorrect . Living Environment Regents June 2006 Question 10 Ecology Correct Answer : Option 3 hide from predators . Stick insects have chromatic adaptations to hide from insectivorous animals like moles and robins . In this way , they have less probability of being seen by these predators . Option 1 is incorrect because stick insects are not competing with all birds . Stick insects are herbivores , while birds are herbivores or carnivores . They only compete with herbivorous birds but not with the birds with different mode of nutrition . Option 2 is incorrect because stick insects are not plants , they just look like plants in order to adapt to their environment . This is called chromatic adaptation wherein pigment granules migrate in their epidermis . Since stick insects are not plants , they can not make their own food . Option 4 is incorrect . Molecular adaptation is the common way used by insects to avoid toxic waste materials ( e.g . leaf beetles ) . < < Start < Prev 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Next > End > > Page 1 of 8

Political Calculations We Would Have Lost .. . . If we had put money on our sentiments yesterday ! We 're not normally pessimistic , but we have to admit that the combination of bad economic news dominating this election year and what we feel to have been an overstated level of economic growth recorded for the third quarter of 2007 would have led us to put money on the GDP growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2007 showing up in negative territory . As it happened , the one-quarter annualized Real GDP growth rate came in at a low 0.6 % for the BEA 's advance release of this figure for final quarter of 2007 , and at 2.7 % over the much less volatile two-quarter period ending in the final quarter of 2007 . Our GDP bullet charts show these figures alongside where both sets of growth rate date were at the end of the two previous economic quarters , and against the backdrop of historic economic growth performance since 1980 ( the `` temperature '' scale ) : The lousy track record of sentiment however is why we trust our impartial numbers when it comes to peering into the economic future . The following chart shows where we expect GDP to be through the first quarter of 2008 for our Modified Limo GDP forecasting method , as well as where it would be through the third quarter of 2008 using the Skeptical Optimist 's Climbing Limo forecasting method : The climbing limo GDP forecasting method , which looks three quarters ahead in time , would anticipate 2008Q1 's Real GDP to be 11,709.6 billion in chained 2000 U.S . dollars . Meanwhile , our modified limo GDP forecasting method , which looks just one quarter ahead in time , would anticipate that Real GDP will be 11,757.4 billion chained 2000 U.S . dollars . Both figures would suggest a low , yet positive increase from the 11,677.4 billion chained 2000 U.S . dollars that the BEA has set for the level of Real GDP in its advance release for 2007Q4 . Is n't it cool that we can have an economy that the media screams about being especially volatile , yet we can still pretty reliably anticipate where GDP will be some three to nine months in advance ? And all we have to do is learn to ignore the screaming media .. . . Labels : gdp , gdp forecast Average Annual Health Insurance Costs in the US How much does it cost U.S . employers to provide health insurance to their employees ? As it happens , the answer depends on what kind of health insurance that employers make available to their employees , the number of people who are covered by the employee 's insurance and also the size of the company for which they work . Our first two charts revealing how much the average annual premiums are by health insurance plan type presents how much it costs both employees and employers for covered Single workers , at both small companies ( those between 3 and 199 workers ) : and large companies ( those with more than 200 workers ) : The next two charts present similar data for workers whose families are also covered by the various employer-provided health insurance plan types , first for those working at small companies ( data is for a family of four ) : and now for those working for companies with more than 200 employees : The tables we 're presenting below are drawn from the Kaiser Family Foundation 's 2006 Annual Survey of Employer Health Benefits , provide the average annual costs according to these factors and also break down how much of the total cost is paid by the employer and how much is paid by the employee . We 've used our dynamic table sorting technology in creating the tables , which allows you to rank the date in the tables by clicking the appropriate column heading so you can find which types of plans are the most or least costly . The first table provides data for covered single workers : 2006 Average Annual Premiums for Covered Single Workers by Plan Type Plan Type Firm Size ( Number of Workers ) Total Annual Cost [ $ USD ] Employer Annual Contribution [ $ USD ] Employer 's Percentage of Total Cost Employee Annual Contribution [ $ USD ] Employee 's Percentage of Total Cost Conventional Small ( 3-199 ) 4,222 4,222 100.0 % 0 0.0 % Conventional Large ( 200+ ) 4,020 4,020 100.0 % 0 0.0 % HMO Small ( 3-199 ) 3,899 3,427 87.9 % 472 12.1 % HMO Large ( 200+ ) 4,114 3,472 84.4 % 642 15.6 % PPO Small ( 3-199 ) 4,505 4,014 89.1 % 491 10.9 % PPO Large ( 200+ ) 4,326 3,618 83.6 % 708 16.4 % POS Small ( 3-199 ) 4,109 3,478 84.6 % 631 15.4 % POS Large ( 200+ ) 4,238 3,599 84.9 % 639 14.8 % HDHP/SO Small ( 3-199 ) 3,206 2,732 85.2 % 474 14.8 % HDHP/SO Large ( 200+ ) 3,589 2,932 81.7 % 657 18.3 % The next table provides data for covered workers with families consisting of four members . Note that for many of the plans , while the employer 's portion is less than four times their cost for a single worker , the employee 's portion of the total premium cost for each type of plan is approximately four times that of a single worker , or even more : 2006 Average Annual Premiums for Covered Workers with Families by Plan Type Plan Type Firm Size ( Number of Workers ) Total Annual Cost [ $ USD ] Employer Annual Contribution [ $ USD ] Employer 's Percentage of Total Cost Employee Annual Contribution [ $ USD ] Employee 's Percentage of Total Cost Conventional Small ( 3-199 ) 10,800 10,800 100.0 % 0 0.0 % Conventional Large ( 200+ ) 10,829 10,829 100.0 % 0 0.0 % HMO Small ( 3-199 ) 11,137 6,945 62.4 % 4,192 37.6 % HMO Large ( 200+ ) 11,339 8,741 77.1 % 2,598 22.9 % PPO Small ( 3-199 ) 11,793 8,296 70.3 % 3,497 29.7 % PPO Large ( 200+ ) 11,752 9,124 77.6 % 2,628 22.4 % POS Small ( 3-199 ) 10,706 7,187 67.1 % 3,519 32.9 % POS Large ( 200+ ) 11,573 8,688 75.1 % 2,885 24.9 % HDHP/SO Small ( 3-199 ) 8,896 6,830 76.8 % 2,006 23.2 % HDHP/SO Large ( 200+ ) 10,013 7,604 75.9 % 2,409 24.1 % Descriptions of the various types of health insurance plans are available through our post showing which types of plans were the most commonly used in the United States in 2006 ! Where are we going with all this ? Not necessarily where you might think , although we 're aiming to get there next week ! Labels : health care The Most Popular Health Plans in the U.S . A lot of people talk about health insurance plans , but have you ever noticed that no one really knows what kind of health insurance people actually have ? We 've been mining the data presented in the Kaiser Family Foundation 's 2006 Annual Survey of Employer Health Benefits for another project , so we 'd thought we 'd extract the latest available data for U.S . employer-provided health insurance plans and present it in the following chart : For the sake of reference , here 's a bit of discussion about each type of health insurance plan : Conventional : The least common type of employer-provided insurance plan today , in which the employer covers 100 % of health insurance plan costs . Called `` conventional '' since it used to be the dominant form of employer-provided health coverage in the U.S . as recently as two decades ago , before becoming far too expensive for employers to provide . HMO : Health Maintenance Organization , which also includes Exclusive Provider Organizations ( EPO ) . HMOs were the first serious alternative to `` conventional '' health care plans , but were soon overtaken by PPOs . PPO : 9202a8c04000641f800000000046a8f0 , the most common employer provided health insurance plan today , by a more than 3-to-1 margin to the next most common plan type , HMOs . POS : Point Of Service health insurance plans are a kind of hybrid between PPOs and HMOs , and may sometimes be classified as an `` enhanced-HMO . '' These plans combine the standard HMO access to a pre-approved network of health providers with the ability for individuals to select certain kinds of specialists outside the network without having to go through their Primary Care Provider ( PCP ) first . Not quite as popular as PPOs , which offer greater flexibility . HDHP/SO : 9202a8c04000641f80000000047f49c1 with Savings Option , such as a 9202a8c04000641f800000000087ff74 ( HRA ) or a 9202a8c04000641f800000000035ef01 ( HSA ) . This is the newest available option for employer-provided health insurance which has only really existed since 2005 . Even in that short time , HDHP/SO type plans have already surpassed `` conventional '' plans in popularity , even though the wide majority of U.S . employers have yet to adopt or offer the option to their employees . Labels : health care Better Ideas for Fiscal Stimulus Packages Now that we 've taken on a Nobel-prize winner 's take on what should be in an economic stimulus package , and double-underlined why government-legislated economic stimulus packages are always too late to be genuinely effective , we thought we might consider what should be on the Congress ' list of things to do for the next time when the economy takes a turn for the worse . In fact , we 'll do more than that . We 'll also tell you what might keep the handful of things we 're about to suggest from working ! Did Joseph Stiglitz do that for you ? Heck no ! We do economics with two hands around here , the way it 's meant to be done , so you do n't have to go trolling for those fancy journal peer reviews or snarky critiques on anonymously written blogs . Or maybe at least on other anonymously written blogs ! Political Calculations ' Guide to Fiscal Stimulus Our Suggestion Why It Should Be Done Why it May Not Work Arrange the economic stimulus in advance with data-driven triggers to put into effect . We already know what an economic stimulus package looks like : tax cuts or rebates for individuals , increases in unemployment insurance , food stamp and other welfare benefits that benefit those who experience economic distress , such as additional resources for retraining displaced workers , etc . We also have a pretty good handle on what events often precede or coincide with recessions : extended yield curve inversions , declining stock dividends , etc . The combination of these things means that we can have the basic parts of any economic stimulus package go into effect automatically without requiring a single additional act of Congress . We might increase spending unnecessarily in the case of false alarms . A fiscal stimulus package on autopilot may not address unique concerns that apply to the economic conditions of the day , such as the actual size and seriousness of the pending recession . Bureaucratic government agencies may not be capable of implementing changes rapidly enough to be effective . Some politicians and bureaucratic agencies would have the negative incentive to prolong a recession , as they might provide increased funding for politician or lobbyist-preferred programs and recipients . Focus fiscal policies on removing obstacles preventing the Federal Reserve from being able to take stronger action sooner . A good example for 2008 is inflation . Here , the Fed is constrained by how much it can cut interest rates by the high rate of inflation in the economy . The government could help reduce inflation by curtailing the fiscal policies that exist that contribute to creating higher levels of inflation , such as ethanol subsidies . These subsidies have created higher costs for both raw crops and have generally increased the cost of food products . An interesting side benefit is that the savings from cutting such inflationary subsidy programs could be redirected to fund the automatic economic stimulus programs without adding to a potential fiscal crisis on top of a worsening economy . The government does n't subsidize anything because it 's a good idea that will provide substantial benefits for the country 's population . Instead , politicians seek to subsidize the very special interests of those who fund their political campaigns . Those campaign contributors are the kind of people who are often incapable of recognizing the economically destructive nature of having the government fund their self interest , while the politicians are often the kind of people who care more about their power base and ego than acting in the best interest of those they pretend to represent . That both are the kinds of people who deserve to be the designated losers in this situation is absolutely lost upon them and they 'll do everything they can to undermine any such desubsidation . Make government go faster to support new businesses and expanding businesses . Government can do a lot to speed up the process of licensing new businesses and to accelerate any regulatory review associated with expanding existing businesses . The government can do both at relatively low cost by having the government bureaucrats responsible for processing these activities work longer hours in the short term and by adding additional resources ranging from more people to automation technology to increase the productivity of government bureaucrats performing these tasks in the medium to long term . The high rate of unionization of government employees guarantees that union leaders will attempt to prevent both longer hours in the short term and higher productivity gained through automating the work of government employees as both measures would fail to increase the amount of dues they receive from the workers they `` represent . '' See previous example for a description of the rent-seeking dynamics . They will support adding more people , but new people take time to train and become truly effective , making this aspect the least likely to achieve the aim of accelerating the business expansion needed to counteract a deepening recession . Make government go way faster to support businesses going out of business . When a business goes out of business , it can take months if not years to unwind all the claims of the parties associated with the business , even if its going out of business has nothing to do with the state of the economy . That 's time in which the resources owned by the business are tied up and can not really be redirected into other new productive economic activity . If the economy is entering a period in which higher rates of businesses can be expected to go out of business , accelerating the process of closing businesses and bankruptcy proceedings can only a good thing , which the government can achieve by devoting additional resources to support these activities . Conflicts among the parties involved in the closing of a business or a bankruptcy may drag out the proceedings independently of any action the government takes to speed the process . The rate of businesses closing or closing by going through bankruptcy proceedings can be politically sensitive . Politicians may have a perverse incentive to delay the process of closing a business to keep the numbers low to be able to claim things are n't as bad as they might appear if the process were capable of moving more quickly to meet the true needs of business . The last point regarding the politically sensitive reporting of the number of business closings is similar to how politicians and bureaucrats in countries with universal health care programs champion the high utilization rates and `` efficiency '' with which certain medical procedures are performed . In reality , this situation represents the illusion of efficiency since these apparently high rates really only exist because the health care system has a major shortage of people or equipment needed to perform these procedures and is actually incapable of meeting the nation 's true health care needs . See : Cuba , Canada , United Kingdom , etc .. . . Labels : economics , ideas , politics Always Behind the Curve As long as we 're talking about the so-called `` stimulus '' package the Congress is considering today , we should also consider why what the government is considering may be ineffective at achieving its goals in fighting off a recession . Fortunately , for us , Doc Palmer is on the case ! Here 's our quick list version of the reasons he 's outlinked for why fiscal policy that requires acts of Congress to enact are less than effective at staving off recessions : Recognition Lag - politicians are slow to recognize a developing recession . - politicians are slow to recognize a developing recession . Decision Lag - deciding what to do slows politicians down even more . - deciding what to do slows politicians down even more . Implementation Lag - making what the politicians have decided to do actually happen takes more time . - making what the politicians have decided to do actually happen takes more time . Effect Lag - Once the stimulus is in the economy , it takes time for it to work . Let 's cover the first two together . Here is our electronic version of a chart that Bruce Bartlett recently used in an op-ed to demonstrate how slow elected politicians have been historically in recognizing that they might need to respond to a slowing economy and deciding what to do about it . You can sort the dynamic table below according to the various column headings by clicking on them : Dates of Recessions and Antirecession Programs Recession Begins Recession Ends `` Stimulus '' Legislation Enacted Months After Recession Begins Months After Recession Ends Antirecession `` Stimulus Package '' Legislation Details 1948-Nov 1949-Oct 1949-Oct 11 0 Advance Planning for Public Works Act , 13 October 1949 1957-Aug 1958-Apr 1958-Apr 8 0 Federal Aid Highway Act , 16 April 1958 1957-Aug 1958-Apr 1958-Jul 11 3 River and Harbor Act , Flood Control Act and Water Supply Act , 3 July 1958 1960-Apr 1961-Feb 1961-May 13 3 Area Redevelopment Act , 1 May 1961 1960-Apr 1961-Feb 1962-Sep 29 19 Public Works Acceleration Act , 14 Sep 1962 1969-Dec 1970-Nov 1971-Aug 32 9 Public Works and Economic Development Act Amendments , 5 Aug 1971 1973-Nov 1975-Mar 1975-Mar 16 0 Tax Reduction Act , 29 Mar 1975 1973-Nov 1975-Mar 1976-Jul 32 16 Public Works Employment Act , 22 Jul 1976 1973-Nov 1975-Mar 1977-May 42 26 Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act , 13 May 1977 1981-Jul 1982-Nov 1983-Jan 18 2 Surface Transportation Assistance Act , 6 Jan 1983 1981-Jul 1982-Nov 1983-Mar 20 4 Emergency Jobs Appropriations Act , 24 March 1983 1990-Jul 1991-Mar 1991-Dec 17 9 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act , 18 Dec 1991 1990-Jul 1991-Mar 1993-Apr 33 25 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act , 23 Apr 1993 2001-Mar 2001-Nov 2001-Jun 3 -5 Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconcilation Act , 7 Jun 2001 The only time the government was ever ahead of the game was in 2001 , when it enacted a stimulus package some 5 months before the end of a recession . But that does n't mean that the stimulus package enacted in that year was particularly effective at making the recession end any sooner . Of all the things that delay an effective fiscal response to an economic recession , implementation lag is perhaps the greatest problem . Governments are bureaucratic organizations that are not capable of implementing rapid change effectively . Doc Palmer estimates that implementation lag prevents fiscal policy from taking effect for anywhere from 1 to 8 months . Beyond that , there 's also the question of how long it takes for positive results to appear as a result of the `` stimulative '' fiscal policy . Doc Palmer suggests that three months to a year may pass before a stimulus package can fully take effect in the economy . And then there 's also the question of the effectiveness of the economic fiscal `` stimulus '' , which we 'll leave alone as others have capably covered that territory . Assuming the very best case by adding the best case implementation and effect lag times together , one month for implementagion lag and three months for effect lag , or rather , four months combined , would mean that the stimulus package of 2001 became effective just one month before the recession ended in November of that year . We strongly doubt anyone noticed .. . . Labels : economics , politics , recession forecast
`` In the beginning was the Word . Then came the fucking word processor . Then came the thought processor . Then came the death of literature . And so it goes . '' The Scholar 's Tale is the emotional center of the novel . The college professor on `` Midwest College Planet '' wrestles with the creator/creation relationship with the 9202a8c04000641f8000000000c7b775 . It 's a very sad tale , and I recommend at least making it this far before deciding whether or not to put the book down . .. . I honestly have no idea what to think of The Captain 's Tale . I remember it and the Soldier 's Tale do n't really make sense until the end of the series , though . The Detective 's Tale is a 9202a8c04000641f800000000000daab noir story . So , you know , awesome . I feel like this story is when the setting of the World Web really gels and you begin to get an idea of what exactly is at stake . Finally , the Consul 's Tale is part 9202a8c04000641f8000000000033717 , and part an attempt to tie the other tales together from the other side of the story . All in all , it 's the cornerstone of the setting , and all build up for the Fall . But it 's all necessary reading , and it 's engaging . Hell , I could n't stop myself from immediately picking up Fall and reading the first few chapters as soon as I finished Hyperion . I recommend it . Have something to say ? Please comment ! For a novel that 's literally 9202a8c04000641f80000000000112c1 in , I 've always had a soft spot for the . The plot is a simple frame story designed to introduce the setting and main characters to the readers before the epic sequel , which I jumped right into.I read them as a teenager , but I recommend it for adults . I have spoken about why this particular series is an inspiration to me , but here I 'm reviewing the first book.The book begins with a simple premise : seven pilgrims are on their way to the Time Tombs to visit the Shrike . As the setting becomes established , you realize what all this means . On the way , they decide to tell their stories , knowing that there is a traitor in their midst.The Priest 's Tale is interesting . Do n't often see the Catholic Church in science fiction unless it 's by post-break 9202a8c04000641f800000000002dbda . It 's an interesting tale , and not for the squeamish or easily offended Christians out there.The Soldier 's Tale is the weakest tale in the book . I read it when I was a teen , and again as an adult , and I do n't know how it could be better , but each time I find myself disinterested . Perhaps it is the Colonel himself , a blatant template for Master Chief . Others might like the tale better than I do.The Poet 's Tale is a fascinating , satirical examination of the art of writing , and as a result is the first direct appearance of the series 's overarching theme : the relationship between creator and creation .

It 's no secret that yoga has become a commodity . But this week at the Yoga Journal Conference I found something unexpected .. . yogis giving back . What was once an ancient Hindu practice aimed at bringing about mental clarity and overall well-being , has today become a popular 9202a8c04000641f80000000008c99a9 accompanied by hundreds of clothing and accessory companies making millions off the purported needs of the average American Yogi . A February 2005 poll by Harris Interactive and Yoga Journal magazine revealed that about 16.5 million Americans spend nearly $ 3 billion annually on yoga classes and products . With this in mind , and coming from Boulder , Colorado where yoga studios are almost as prevalent as ATMs , I headed up to the YMCA of the Rockies outside of Estes Park to spend a day at the annual Yoga Journal Conference . Now , I 'm not the most likely attendant of such a conference , given that I have spent my career focused on human rights in war zones and I can hardly call myself a Yogi , though I have attended a class or two in my life . To be honest , I went expecting to find a lot of white , upper class , exercise-freaks wearing $ 80 yoga pants , gushing over rock star-status teachers , and focusing on , well , themselves . And to be really honest , there was plenty of that going on . But what I did n't expect , what stays with me now that the conference has ended , was how many people and companies I met , in just one day , that were talking about some aspect of giving back . The ancient concept of Seva ( Sanskrit for service ) is an integral part of yogic teachings , yet it has been less emphasized in the ever-growing tide of `` yoga for Me ! '' But , as I discovered , there are islands of `` other '' floating in this enormous yogic sea . First , I spoke briefly with Alan Zucker , Council Member for the Green Yoga Association about greening the Yoga Journal Conference itself ( this year they focused on eliminating plastic water bottles ) and how real change starts with educating the masses to make positive `` green '' choices with their purchasing power . Over the years Alan has seen the large Yoga companies respond in kind with renewable , non-sweatshop , organic clothing and accessories , and today building greener yoga studios is all the rage . Next , I talked with a woman named Karyn from Bali Malas . Made from 9202a8c04000641f80000000004c763d beads harvested in Indonesia , these malas are meant for use in meditation practice . But digging a little deeper I learned that the proceeds from these malas support Bumi Sehat , a birthing and wellness center in Bali , whose goal is `` conflict resolution and peace building , one mother , one baby , and one family at a time '' .. . now they were speaking my language . Karyn also spoke about knowing the Balinese women who string the malas and the income generation it has provided for them and their families . Feeling encouraged , I moved on to speak with folks selling the Shakti Mat , a lightweight plasticized version of the ancient Indian `` bed of nails '' , meant to increase energy and relieve muscle tension . Surely this product , a recent arrival in the US from Sweden , was a classic example of the West appropriating an Eastern tradition for its own benefit . Or was it ? Speaking with Shakti Mat owner , Om Mokshanada , I learned that his goal is to use proceeds from the sale of the mat to help people in need in India . They plan to build a school and orphanage in the Himalayan Mountains and their website has an entire section devoted to their factory and well cared for employees in Varanasi , India . Finally , over a vegan lunch , I had the serendipitous honor of meeting Rob Schware , Board Member of the Give Back Yoga Foundation . This non-profit out of Takoma Park , Maryland has the goal of providing funds for Yoga teachers to develop and execute yoga programming for under-served communities in the US . Founded on the belief that classical yoga ( the asanas , the breathing and the meditation ) has the ability to transform human consciousness , and that yoga in the US has primarily been a privileged and expensive tool available to the elite , the Give Back Yoga Foundation aims to support yoga teachers to provide free yoga to under-resourced socio-economic communities . In essence , they provide grants for yogis to undertake the Seva aspect of their path by offering yoga to disadvantaged communities who can benefit . They have supported free yoga for women in shelters , prisoners and veterans suffering from PTSD . Recently , two stars of the yoga world , Seane Corn and David Swenson , joined the Give Back Foundation 's Advisory Board , effectively making it cool to give back . At the end of the day , I left the conference feeling encouraged about the future of yoga and the potential for its teachings to create positive change in the world . We live in a society that emphasizes self-obsession and spends billions advertising products to make us look and feel better . Although I can not say that the yoga world is bucking that trend all together , I can say that a storm is brewing , and it is beginning on the non-PVC , recycled material , yoga mat that donates back . Yes , most people come to yoga motivated solely to better themselves , but if this wave of giving and service continues to grow , it could be an example to exercise movements everywhere .. . instead of just obsessing about what we need for ourselves , we can take the teachings that have helped us and use them to alleviate the suffering of others . Do you practice yoga ? Have you had an experience with yoga that is more about giving back and less about you ? Comment below !

Theis the 9202a8c04000641f800000000001a545 that contains the 9202a8c04000641f80000000000140e1 .This name derives from its appearance as a dim `` milky '' glowing band arching across the night sky , in which the naked eye can not distinguish individual stars . The term `` Milky Way '' is a translation of the 9202a8c04000641f80000000000b4c42 , from the 9202a8c04000641f800000000007ad3e ( pr . , `` milky circle '' ) .The Milky Way appears like a band because it is a disk-shaped structure being viewed from inside . The fact that this faint band of light is made up of stars was proven in 1610 when 9202a8c04000641f8000000000019238 used his telescope to resolve it into individual stars . In the 1920s , observations by astronomer 9202a8c04000641f8000000000016a09 showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.More info and detail about Milky Way
Islamism : Mosque in nail salon islamists meet in Bochum local An original translation by Michael Laudahn From Der Westen Sami A has connections to radical , islamist circles and clearly preaches in Bochum . Bochum : Suddenly they were there . Since a few weeks , radical-islamist salafists have met on Eugenstrasse , Bochum . Behind this is a an ex-bodyguard of Osama bin Laden officially , however , his name Sami A does not appear . Authorities became attentive only after being tipped by citizens . This weekend , mezzo sopranist Karolina Gumos should not sleep with an open window she would find little tranquility . The star at the present 9202a8c04000641f800000000db2db80 has been accomodated on Eugenstrasse next door to the mosque presently established by Sami A and his coreligionists . 'Some time between midnight and two , the night is over here ' , says a neighbour . 'Then the islamists leave the mosque . Then the noise rises to unsupportable levels . ' The three women sitting at the coffee table are well informed . They know who he is . 'This is the bin Laden guy ' , says one of them , 'it 's him who makes the mosque . ' The fact that Sami A 's prayer house project cover was blown away is no thanks to the 9202a8c04000641f80000000003ec1ae . Not to the police either . It 's the merit of a 61-year old woman who is a nightwatch at a home for the mentally retarded . She lives in the neighbourhood . And she gave the decisive tip . She reported the mosque-like activities with the ordnungsamt [ ordnung = order , amt = office ] , complained about the nocturnal disturbances of the peace . Covered display windows of the former nail salon on Eugenstrasse : Since about four weeks , mosque activities have been going on here . Her tip had the effect of a wake-up call . Suddenly , the Verfassungsschutz was on location . Last week , Uwe S had a visitor . An agent showed him his id , then asked him questions . What it was about that mosque . What kind of people they were . Uwe S is the landlord of the 200 square meter shop , where up to 60 believing moslems have been meeting for weeks . He knew Sami A as a religious man from next-door , says he . 'In march we talked . He was interested in this object . ' The preacher , however , kept out of the formalities . 'He sent a younger person for this ' , says the landlord . Logically enough , the name of Sami A does n't appear in relation to the mosque . Page 2 This roll is tailor-made for him : pulling the strings in the background . Discreet , quiet , soft . Therefore , the last two weeks will not have been a good time for Sami A , for never had he been watched more closely than since 6 august 2012 . It was the day when the WAZ [ this paper ] traced him in Stahlhausen . The exposal of the bin Laden bodyguard triggered a downright media hysteria . The man with the personal contacts to the top of terror organisation , Al-Qaeda , no longer dared to leave the house because of the size of the pack waylaying him . At least two times , Sami A did not appear at the police station , where he must show up each day . His lawyer excused him , according to what we hear . Her client ails , is psychologically stricken , not a match for the trouble around him . There he was again , the sensitive Sami A : the one with the soft handshake , past whom you would n't put an RPG , the weapon he once used to protect bin Laden . Today , Sami A probably feels better . He keeps on denying to talk to the WAZ . His lawyer denies , on his behalf , everything the Verfassungsschutz and BKA , judges and federal prosecutors know about him . Now , he needs no longer jet on his blue motor scooter through the city , when he wants to spread his radical belief . He needs not even walk five minutes to reach his new realm . 'No ' , he has n't hired this object , says his lawyer . She does n't say much more . Not a word about the fact that her client is the driving force behind the project , just as confirmed by the landlord . Also other facts remain covered , just as the display windows of the former nail salon on Eugenstrasse . Whether Sami A continues to give religious lessons ; what he teaches , whom and where such questions 'will not be answered by my client ' . Police now patrol more frequently in this street , residents say . 'As if this would make any difference . ' Promises made by the interior minister [ of the North-Rhine Westfalia state ] are met with scorn and sneer . 'Talking about protection : We are being left alone , and we need to take care of ourselves . ' A plan circulates : to offer Uwe S money and buy the shop from him . 'Maybe that way we get rid of the mosque . ' And another thing is important : 'We get along well with foreigners . At the corner , there is another mosque . Those people are nice . But we do n't want these salafists . They put our children in danger . ' UPDATE 2012/8/21 Islamism suspicion : City of Bochum stops mosque activities on Eugenstrasse This former nail salon on Eugenstrasse , Bochum is to be converted into a mosque the city is in possession of the application . The city , however , has reacted by stopping the unauthorised prayer-room activities . Bochum : Mosque activities at a former nail salon on Eugenstrasse , Bochum have been stopped . The administration has forbidden the unauthorised use of this building as a place for assembly . According to rumours , an ex-bodyguard of Osama bin Laden wanted to build a mosque there this created much fuss . There are news in the case of the planned mosque in Bochum : After recent days ' headlines , the city of Bochum has prohibited the 'unauthorised use ' of the former Eugenstrasse nail salon as an assembly venue . As reported earlier , there were serious rumours that a former bodyguard of Osama bin Laden wanted to establish a mosque in those rooms . Only a few weeks earlier became known that this man called Sami A lives in Bochum . Tipped by citizens , the authorities ' attention was drawn to the predominantly nocturnal assemblies in that building . 'We will not have that unauthorised activities take place in a closed shop ' , emphasised municipal building officer Ernst Kratzsch in a press communiqu . According to his words , the residents ' concerns are taken 'very seriously ' , while everything was undertaken with police to prevent unauthorised activities . It is a good sign that residents 'carefully watch what is happening in their quarter ' . The Bochum city administration had confirmed already at the end of last week that it had received an application for changing the use of these rooms as an assembly venue . In this context , Sami A does not appear as a player ; but he is being watched by the authorities . According to informations , he once was a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden , and he is considered one of Germany 's most dangerous jihadists . The Bundesanwaltschaft [ General State Prosecutor ] charges him to have decisively radicalised two indicted members of the 'Dsseldorfer Zelle ' [ no easy reference available ; try Google , if interested ] .
is an Indian actress ; her full name is . She currently acts in many south-Indian films . She started her career as a 14-year-old artist in the Government of India project 'Kadambari ' , which is a Bana Bhatta classic from the 5th century AD . It was made in Sanskrit and Hindi and telecast on DD National network . For this project , Madhhurima had been spotted in a Mumbai music recording studio by the world famous Indian film director 9202a8c04000641f80000000009db845 . She had been recording children 's songs in her voice . After 'Kadambari ' , Iyer , impressed by her work and beauty , offered her the role of Sita in his 9202a8c04000641f8000000000058773 that he was planning as a multinational film with foreign actors and with Sanjay Dutt in the role of Ravana . He also gave her a certificate for her good acting talent . Iyer died during the planning stages of the film . Though offers from films and TV serials did pour in after that , Madhhurima , being from a non-film background , immersed herself in her studies and rejected the offers . While pursuing her 5-year law studies , she was offered women-oriented lead roles in Telugu films , As the roles portrayed powerful , modern , professional personalities like a doctor who was a criminal psychiatrist , an engineer who is an industrialist , with strong social messages , she accepted the roles and became a Telugu star overnight while continuing her law studies . Madhhurima has learnt ghazals and bhajans from her mother and classical Hindustani music . She is also trained in Kathak and Bharat Natyam and western dance . She is also talented in drawing and painting but could not pursue this interest further . Madhhurima comes from a middle-class family of professionals . Her father is a mechanical engineer who has served in the Indian Navy and is now General Manager of the largest private shipyard of India . Her mother has been a researcher in the field of Virology and is a content writer who has worked in multinationals in the IT sector and is now a novelist .
Last night I saw a fascinating documentary about a group of Mardu people 's first contact with Europeans . As Australia entered the space race the group of about twenty women and children found themselves literally in the firing line . In 1964 a rocket , the Blue Streak , was about to be launched from 9202a8c04000641f8000000000383ee4 in South Australia . The `` dump zone for the rocket was the area of the Percival Lakes in the Great Sandy Desert , Western Australia . A pair of patrol officers was dispatched to the area to make sure that the region was uninhabited . Of course it was n't . Pretty soon they found recent fires and human tracks . Initial attempts to bring the group out of the desert were thwarted by rain rain that had been cleverly organised by one of the young boys ! Several months later a second attempt was concocted . With assistance of two Martu men from the mission of 9202a8c04000641f8000000008d2642b , the group were located and subsequently brought to Jigalong where many still reside . Two of the young girls were Yuwali and Thelma . The film comprises amazing archival footage of both the first encounter in the desert , archival footage from Woomera and from Jigalong , as well as interviews with Yuwali and Thelma ; as well as with Terry Long , one of the surviving patrol officers . It was fascinating to see hear the same events recounted from two rather different perspectives . Most of the story of the encounter was recounted in Martu Wangka , and was filmed in the very place from where the group was taken . The cinematography is very beautiful , especially the timelapse photography of the starts over the desert truly stunning . However , the real star of the film is Yuwali both as an old woman , and as a 17 year old girl . Yuwali was taken out of the desert with a hairstyle that fashion gurus would copy for generations to come , only to have her bangs chopped off by a bunch of squares with short backs and sides . It might have been the sixties elsewhere but it was obviously still the fifties in the Pilbara . On a less light-hearted note , one of the women with Hansen 's Disease was carted off in a plane and promptly died . The film however is far from a tragedy . These are proud people with a great story to tell . And it 's an important piece of Australian history . The film is based on the book Cleared Out , by Sue Davenport , Peter Johnson and Yuwali . Contact is showing at the Chauvel cinema in Paddington , Sydney , for two weeks , or if enough people go and see it , possibly for longer . It will screen in Melbourne for a couple of weeks at Cinema Nova in Melbourne from September 17th .
Last night 's performance of SPRING AWAKENING was magnificent -- the best I 've seen from a Broadway cast in a long , long time . It normally would be surprising to see such focus from performers who have been `` trapped '' in the Groundhog Day -like cycle of the grueling Broadway show schedule that wears the energy level of the actors way , way down this far into a run ( the show began previewing on Broadway in November 2006 ) , but everyone was giving the audience their best . I think this had mainly to do with the fact that the two leads , 9202a8c04000641f80000000056d8b8a and the perpetually spitting 9202a8c04000641f80000000056b2b81 , are departing the show in a little over a week on May 18th . It was good to see them perform one last time , and I 'm sure we 'll revisit the show in a few months after the new cast has settled into their roles . Side note : The church across the street from the theatre has electronic bells that chime show tunes ! ! While we were waiting to get in , the bells chimed the melody to THERE 'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS from ANNIE GET YOUR GUN . We went to Virgil 's Barbecue in Times Square before the show and it was packed with people watching the Kentucky Derby . I had never watched it before , and honestly was surprised that the entire thing came and went in the space of time that it took our waiter to take our orders . All of the buildup for one lousy minute ? ? ! ! Wow . Our meal was decent , but not great . We all ordered the Memphis Pork Ribs , and while they were good , I did n't think they were succulent enough , and actually they were a bit dry in parts . My mac and cheese side was mushy at best and my beans were a little too sweet for my liking . The cornbread muffins were good , but could have been browned and crisped more on top . The service was okay for a Times Square , heavily touristy locale . Over all , I give Virgil 's Barbecue a B- for average food and service . The peonies I bought yesterday have already popped fully open and smell wonderfully . Spring is really chugging along .. . I ca n't believe it 's already 9202a8c04000641f800000000023cb25 season . The lilacs are also in full swing at my corner deli , where I sometimes buy flowers . I ca n't believe summer is nearly upon us . We started Sunday morning with a long overdue trip to Dim Sum Go Go , where we had oodles of steamed dumplings and fried goodies brought to us seconds after ordering by the highly efficient staff ( i.e . they want us to eat and get out of there to make way for new customers as quickly as they serve us ) . Matthew had been complaining that we never do dim sum , so we 're putting it back into rotation when we 're in town . If you have n't been there on a Sunday and are planning on going , get there early -- meaning before 11AM -- or you 'll face a long wait on the street outside the restaurant . My favorite thing on the menu ? The fried mango and shrimp dumplings -- SO GOOD ! ! It was such a nice walk to Chinatown and after brunch we stopped by the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory , where I had a cup of their super tasty and original Almond Cookie Ice Cream . This is the Gai Daan Jai maker I 've been searching for with zero luck ! Anyone know where I can find one ? I also stopped at the dilapidated looking cart on Canal and Mott that sells the delicious egg cakes I adore and again tried to ask the cart attendant , who speaks next to zero English , where I could buy the mold that makes the cakes .. . I 'm hoping someone can help solve this shopping mystery for me : Where can I find the above pictured molds that make the wonderful Chinatown cakes that go by the names Hong Kong Cakes , Egg Puffs , Eggettes and their traditional name , Gai Daan Jai ? ? I have been trying to find one of the cake makers , which are heated over a gas flame and flipped over several times during the cooking of the batter , which resembles waffle batter . Please leave a comment on this post with any information that could lead to the purchase of one of these Gai Daan Jai makers ! ! Yummy House Red Residue On our way home , we picked up a few ingredients from various shops . I just love the many strangely labeled products and signs found throughout Chinatown grocery stores . Mutant Coconut Sweet Macapuno Balls Mutant coconut ? Well , I just googled Macapuno and found THIS .
